An Invitation

If you’ve ever had to start again, you’ll understand this: don’t quit. We’re building a small, precise foundry that turns living fynbos into permanent bronze—art that outlasts us. We’re 90% there. The last 10% happens with the people who believe in what we’re doing.
This isn’t crowdfunding. It’s co-creation. Join the Founding 100 or book a workshop and take home a piece of South African botany, cast by your own hands.

Who I Am

I’m David Junor, a precision caster turned sculptor.
25 years working to fine tolerances taught me one thing: detail is everything. Fifteen of those years were in London’s West End dental labs where a fraction of a millimetre decides success. I ran my own lab, served demanding clients, and then spent years mastering botanical bronze. Now I’m putting that discipline into Timeless Organics in Kommetjie—teaching openly and making work built to endure.

Why This Foundry Exists (Our Story)

Two parents lost their jobs overnight. After nearly a decade making extraordinary botanical bronzes for someone else—and a lifetime honing precision casting—we hit zero. No safety net. No Plan B.
Quitting wasn’t an option. We kept going with stubborn faith and ridiculous hours. The studio you see now is the result: built piece by piece, against the odds. We’re almost finished, and we’re finishing it with our community. If you know our story, you know why this matters.

What We’re Building

Timeless Organics preserves South Africa’s Cape Fynbos in bronze—Proteas, Ericas, Restios, succulents. Real specimens, cast at their peak so the exact geometry of growth survives.
What makes us different:

Open-handed craft — we teach what we know.

Art as archive — every casting preserves a real plant at a real moment.

Community first — the Founding 100 isn’t a gimmick; it’s how we keep workshops accessible and finish the foundry right.

How It’s Made (Lost-Wax, fast)

Invest — The specimen is encased in heat-resistant investment; cell-level detail is captured.

Burnout — 700 °C for 12+ hours; the plant burns away, leaving a perfect void.

Pour — 1 100 °C bronze fills every channel and vein.

Finish — We break out, chase, refine, and patinate (natural bronze, subtle greens, heat-borne golds/browns).

Trust Markers

25 years in high-tolerance metalwork.

15 years in London’s West End dental labs (micron-level accuracy, elite clients).

Lab owner — built and ran a precision lab before transitioning full-time to sculpture.

Botanical bronze specialist — years casting complex plant structures with consistent results.

Closing Note

This work is personal: honest craft, durable beauty, knowledge shared freely, and deep respect for the wild plants that make this place unlike anywhere else on Earth. If this resonates—come make something permanent with us.
