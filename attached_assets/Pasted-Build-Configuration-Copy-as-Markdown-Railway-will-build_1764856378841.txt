Build Configuration

Copy as Markdown
Railway will build and deploy your code with zero configuration, but when necessary, there are several ways to configure this behavior to suit your needs.

Railpack
Railway uses Railpack to build your code. It works with zero configuration, but can be customized using environment variables or a config file. Configuration options include:

Language versions
Build/install/start commands
Mise and Apt packages to install
Directories to cache
For a full list of configuration options, please view the Railpack docs. You can find a complete list of languages we support out of the box here.

Nixpacks
Nixpacks is deprecated and in maintenance mode. New services default to Railpack.

Existing services will continue to work with Nixpacks. To migrate to Railpack, update your service settings or set "builder": "RAILPACK" in your railway.json file.

For services still using Nixpacks, it can be configured with environment variables. For a full list of options, view the Nixpacks docs.

You can find a complete list of languages we support out of the box here.

Customize the Build Command
You can override the detected build command by setting a value in your service settings. This is run after languages and packages have been installed.

Set the Root Directory
The root directory defaults to / but can be changed for various use-cases like monorepo projects.

When specified, all build and deploy commands will operate within the defined root directory.

Note: The Railway Config File does not follow the Root Directory path. You have to specify the absolute path for the railway.json or railway.toml file, for example: /backend/railway.toml

Configure Watch Paths
Watch paths are gitignore-style patterns that can be used to trigger a new deployment based on what file paths have changed.

For example, a monorepo might want to only trigger builds if files are changed in the /packages/backend directory.

When specified, any changes that don't match the patterns will skip creating a new deployment. Multiple patterns can be combined, one per line.

Note, if a Root Directory is provided, patterns still operate from /. For a root directory of /app, /app/**.js would be used as a pattern to match files in the new root.

Here are a few examples of common use-cases:

# Match all TypeScript files under src/
/src/**/*.ts
# Match Go files in the root, but not in subdirectories
/*.go
# Ignore all Markdown files
**
!/*.md
Note, negations will only work if you include files in a preceding rule.
