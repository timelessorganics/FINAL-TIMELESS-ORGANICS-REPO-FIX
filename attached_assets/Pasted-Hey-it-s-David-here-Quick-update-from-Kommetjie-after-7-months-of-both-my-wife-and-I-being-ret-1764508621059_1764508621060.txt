Hey, it’s David here 👋

Quick update from Kommetjie: after 7 months of both my wife and I being retrenched, a new chapter is finally about to start. Timeless Organics is 90% LIVE.

For almost a decade I cast and finished world-renowned bronze sculptures for someone else – they were never mine to sign, but they were mine to master.

Instead of keeping this ridiculous art form “secret” and hidden in the background, I want to open it up. Failing isn’t an option, so I’m carrying on with what I’ve mastered and opening the doors to a small group of people who want to be there from the very start – to see it, learn it, and be part of it.

I’m launching the Timeless Organics Founding 100 – only 100 lifetime seats (50 Founders and 50 Patrons) that help get the studio properly alive and give you serious, tangible value:

• A one-of-a-kind bronze casting (R25k+ value)
• A huge discount on your first 2-day, hands-on workshop to cast your own organic piece with me (fully giftable)
• A lifetime discount code on future workshops (fully giftable for life), bespoke commissions, shop pieces and first dibs on auctions
• These seats are meant to be Timeless – they keep giving, and the benefits can be shared and gifted on for years

The studio is about 90% built. It’s been an enormous undertaking given the circumstances, but this last push is what lights the fires, keeps the lights on, and lets us start pouring years of hard-won skill into bronze – to create, to teach, and to share this mind-bending art form that genuinely melts people’s brains when they see it up close.

Because you’re friends/family and have watched (or heard about) this whole saga unfolding, I’m opening it to you first, with a 24-hour fire-sale launch price before it hits social media:

• Founder seat: R3,000 (public price from Monday: R4,500)
• Patron seat: R4,500 (public price from Monday: R6,000)

These really are Willy Wonka golden tickets… just in bronze 😉

If it’s not for you right now but you immediately think of someone this is for, forwarding this on would help us more than you realise.

Thank you for even reading this. It’s been a brutal year so far, and getting this studio properly alive means the world to us.
