Timeless Organics: Built From Zero. Built To Last.
Why This Foundry Exists
Two parents, two jobs lost overnight. After nearly a decade creating world-class botanical bronzes for someone else—and 25 years mastering precision casting—our family was suddenly left with zero. No contract. No safety net. No Plan B.

Quitting wasn’t an option. We kept building, brick by brick, on stubborn faith and ridiculous hard work. Today, the studio is 90% finished. We did the heavy lifting alone, but the final 10% happens with the people who believe in what we’re doing. This is not crowdfunding; it is co-creation. If you know our story, you know exactly why this matters.

What We Are Building
Timeless Organics is a focused foundry in Kommetjie dedicated to preserving South Africa’s Cape Fynbos in bronze. We take forms that are fleeting in nature—Proteas, Ericas, Restios, and succulents—and cast them so they can outlast us all.

Every piece begins with a real specimen. Through the investment and burnout process, the plant is sacrificed; only its perfect negative remains. We pour bronze into that space to capture the exact geometry of growth, keeping every vein and cell-level texture forever.

Why You Can Trust The Craft
We are applying clinical discipline to art. This foundry is built on:

25 Years of Precision Casting: Deep technical experience in high-tolerance metalwork.

15 Years in London’s West End: A background in elite dental labs where a fraction of a millimeter determines success or failure.

Complex Botanical Expertise: Years spent solving the hardest problems in sculpture to achieve faithful organic reproduction.

We built labs, ran teams, and delivered for demanding clients. Now, that same precision is redirected toward art that matters.

What We Believe
We believe in open-handed craft. We don't hoard knowledge or gatekeep; we teach. We believe in art as an archive, ensuring each casting preserves a living form. Most importantly, we believe in community. The "Founding 100" isn't a gimmick; it is how we finish the foundry and keep prices sane for future workshops and commissions.

Who Is Behind It
David Junor — Sculptor & Founder. I am a precision caster by training and a teacher by instinct. I am building this foundry with my wife and our community because the work matters. We stand for honest craft, durable beauty, and a deep respect for the wild plants that make this place unlike anywhere else on Earth.

An Invitation
If you have ever been forced to start again, you understand this feeling: don't quit.

If you believe in what we are making, join the Founding 100 or book a workshop. Help us finish the last 10%—and take home a piece of South African botany that will outlive us both.
