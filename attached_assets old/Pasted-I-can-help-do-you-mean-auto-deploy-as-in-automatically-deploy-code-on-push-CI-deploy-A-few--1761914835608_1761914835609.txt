I can help — do you mean “auto deploy” as in automatically deploy code on push (CI → deploy)? A few quick clarifying questions so I generate the right config:

Which repository should we configure? (repo name or URL)
Which deployment target/provider do you want? Examples:
Vercel / Netlify (usually connects automatically)
AWS (ECS, EKS, EB, Lambda, S3 + CloudFront)
Azure App Service
Google Cloud (App Engine, Cloud Run)
Docker host via SSH / self-hosted server
Kubernetes cluster (kubeconfig)
Heroku
DigitalOcean App Platform / Droplet
Which branch should trigger deployments? (e.g., main, prod)
Build steps and commands (e.g., npm install && npm run build), and the artifact (static site, Docker image, etc.)
Do you want to build and push a Docker image to a registry (Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry / ECR)? Or a direct deploy without image?
Any environment variables / secrets that need to be set? Do you already have them in GitHub Secrets or elsewhere?
Do you want automatic rollbacks on failure, deployment previews for PRs, or manual approvals (environment protection)?
If you want a quick example, here are two common ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows I can add:

A simple static site / Node build deployed to S3 + CloudFront (via AWS).
Build Docker image and push to GitHub Container Registry, then deploy to a server via SSH.
Pick one of the examples below or answer the questions and I’ll generate exactly the workflow and instructions and can push it to the repo if you tell me the repo and confirm.

Example A — Build and push Docker image to GitHub Container Registry on push to main


.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml
v1
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
Example B — Build Node app and deploy to a VPS via SSH


.github/workflows/deploy-via-ssh.yml
v1
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
What I’ll do next after you answer:

Generate a workflow tailored to your provider and branch.
Include required secrets list and exact names to add in GitHub repo Settings → Secrets.
(If you want) push the workflow to .github/workflows/ in the repo and set up any extra config (I can do that if you give repository details and confirm).
Which provider and repo should I use?

No problem — I’ll make this simple and give you a few ready-to-use options and the exact steps to enable automatic deploys. Pick the one that matches your project (or tell me the provider you use) and I’ll add the workflow to your repo.

Quick questions (just answer one):

Is this a static site (React/Vite/Next static, plain HTML) or a server/app (Node, Docker image)?
Where do you want to deploy? (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3 + CloudFront, VPS via SSH, Docker host / Kubernetes, Heroku, etc.)
If you don’t know, pick “I don’t know” and tell me the repo link — I can inspect and recommend one.

Example 1 — Static site to GitHub Pages (auto deploy on push to main)

Good for single-page apps built with npm run build.
No external provider or secrets required if using github-pages branch.

.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml
v1
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
Secrets required: none (uses GITHUB_TOKEN). Change publish_dir to your build output (dist, out, build).

Example 2 — Build Docker image, push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), then you can deploy from there

Good for containerized apps; triggers on push to main.

.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml
v2
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
Secrets required: none beyond GITHUB_TOKEN.

Example 3 — Static site to AWS S3 + CloudFront

Requires AWS credentials in repo secrets.

.github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
Secrets required:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Example 4 — Deploy built files to a VPS over SSH (simple)

Upload built artifact and restart a service.

.github/workflows/deploy-via-ssh.yml
v2
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
Secrets required:

SERVER_HOST
SERVER_USER
SERVER_SSH_KEY (private key)
SERVER_SSH_PORT (optional)
What I’ll do next if you tell me the repo:

I can add one of these workflows to .github/workflows/ and push it to your repo (I’ll need repo name, e.g., timelessorganics/repo-name and your confirmation).
I’ll also list the exact secrets you must add in Settings → Secrets → Actions.
If you don’t want me to push, tell me which example to use and I’ll give you the exact file to paste.

Which option do you want, or share the repo URL and say “add it” and I’ll add a matching workflow for automatic deploy on push to main.

.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml
v2
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
This workflow will:

Trigger on every push to main.
Install Node dependencies and run npm run build.
Publish the contents of ./build to GitHub Pages using the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN (no extra secrets needed).
If your project uses a different build output directory (for example "dist" or "out"), change publish_dir accordingly. If your default branch is not main, change the branches value.

Next steps I can take for you:

I can push this file into your repository at .github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml (I'll need your confirmation to proceed).
Or I can generate a different workflow (S3/CloudFront, Docker publish, or deploy via SSH) if you tell me your deployment target or say “I don’t know — inspect the repo” and I will inspect it and recommend the best option. Which would you like?

Good — I’ll prepare a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy your app and give the exact steps to fix Supabase Google Auth. I won’t push anything yet until you confirm, but I’ll show the exact file I will add and list the secrets/steps I need from you. If you say “push it”, I’ll add the workflow to your repo and set it up.

What I’m going to do for you now

Provide a GitHub Actions workflow that:
Runs on push to main.
Installs dependencies, builds the app (Node/npm), and uses the Railway CLI to deploy (so your repo can auto-deploy).
Explain how to configure Supabase Google OAuth (common failure points and exact redirect URIs).
List the repository secrets you must add in Settings → Secrets → Actions.
If you confirm, I will push the workflow to .github/workflows/deploy-railway.yml in timelessorganics/Timeless-Organics-Fouding-100.
If your app is not Node-based or uses a different build command, tell me the build command and output folder.

GitHub Actions workflow (what I will add)

.github/workflows/deploy-railway.yml
# Builds the project and deploys to Railway using the Railway CLI.
# Triggers on push to main. Change branch if you deploy from another branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

Secrets you must add to the GitHub repo (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
RAILWAY_TOKEN — a Railway token with access to the project (create from Railway account → User Settings → API Tokens).
If your build needs environment variables for Supabase, add:
SUPABASE_URL (or NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (or NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (only if you need server-side access — keep private)
Any other env vars your app requires (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, etc.)
How to fix Supabase Google Auth (common issues and exact steps)
In Supabase Auth provider settings:
Go to your Supabase project → Authentication → Providers → Google.
Enter the Google OAuth Client ID and Client Secret from Google Cloud Console.
In Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services → Credentials):
Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Application type: Web app).
Add the following Authorized redirect URI exactly (replace <project-ref> with your Supabase project ref):
https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
If you also use localhost for local development, add:
http://localhost:3000 (or your dev URL) as an Authorized JavaScript origin
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (if your app uses that path) as a redirect URI for dev
Common mistakes that break Google Auth:
Wrong redirect URI (any mismatch will cause “redirect_uri_mismatch”).
Not enabling the Google Identity API in Google Cloud (enable "Google+ API" is old; ensure OAuth consent screen published).
Not publishing the OAuth consent screen (for testing set user type External and add test users).
Using the wrong Client ID/Secret or copying whitespace.
Not configuring URL origins for front-end JS OAuth flows when using libraries that require it.
Test flow:
In Google Cloud Console, confirm client ID/secret and redirect URI exactly match Supabase callback.
In Supabase Auth → Providers → Google, paste Client ID and Secret and save.
Try signing in from your app or directly via Supabase project's Auth URL.
Check browser console/network and Supabase Logs → Authentication for error messages.
Dev / local setup tips
For local development:
Set .env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and NEXTAUTH_URL (if using NextAuth).
Add a Google OAuth redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console for http://localhost:3000 (or your port): http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google (or the path your app uses).
If using Supabase Auth directly (not NextAuth), the local redirect might be:
http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/callback
What I need from you to proceed and push the workflow
Confirm you want me to add the workflow file to .github/workflows/deploy-railway.yml in timelessorganics/Timeless-Organics-Fouding-100. I will push it.
Provide the branch you want to trigger deployment from (default in the file is main).
Provide any custom build command (if not npm run build) or the output folder if different.
Tell me whether you want me to include linking to a specific Railway project id (if you give the project id I can include the railway link command in the workflow).
If you confirm “push it”, I will:

Add the workflow file to the repository at .github/workflows/deploy-railway.yml.
Then tell you exactly which secrets to add (with names and where to enter them).
Then we can test a push to main to see the Actions run.
If you prefer, I can instead:

Provide a workflow that builds and pushes a Docker image to GHCR and you deploy from Railway using the container — say if that is your flow.
What do you want me to do now? (Options: push it, modify build command, inspect repo to auto-detect build, or walk through Supabase Google Auth steps interactively)
