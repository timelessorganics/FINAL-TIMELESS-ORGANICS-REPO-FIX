About & Contact David Junor — Founder, Timeless Organics
My foundation in 25 years of technical precision casting began with 15 years in high-end London dental laboratories, including 3 years owning my own Harley Street lab. This work—focusing on metallurgy, investment casting techniques, and assembly—provided the technical mastery required for flawless results.

Returning to Cape Town, I leveraged my specialist technical background, which led me to connect with a globally recognized bronze artist. I became the primary technical fabricator for their botanical bronze collection. In this role, I successfully cast hundreds of botanical bronzes that sold internationally, proving my technical skills at the highest level of the art world. Those pieces weren't mine to sign; the craft became mine to master. Timeless Organics is the necessary next step, putting two decades of proven experience under my own name.

Technical Process: Direct casting from real plant matter, silicon bronze pour, sand/glass bead-blast finish.
Expertise: 25 Years in high-precision investment casting and assembly.
Independent studio; no affiliation implied. Kommetjie, Cape Town. Contact: studio@timeless.organic

The Workshop Experience What you’ll do in 2 days
The 2-Day Botanical Bronze Casting Workshop offers a unique window into the process of investment casting. This is where you create your personal specimen piece.

*The workshop cost is variable, calculated based on your specimen choice (complexity/size), with prices ranging from R1,000 to a maximum of R10,000. Founders and Patrons receive a discount off this final calculated price.*

Proposed Schedule (Kommetjie Studio)
Workshop 1: Mon (12:00–15:00) & Tue (12:00–16:00)
Workshop 2: Thu (12:00–15:00) & Fri (12:00–16:00)
*(The actual value lies in the personal authorship—you melt the bronze and cast a piece of art that, if sold by an expert, starts at R25,000 value. You keep the story and the unique piece.)*

Day 1 (09:30–13:00): intake, invest your cutting, sprues & vents, mould prep, studio tour. Burn‑out runs overnight only.
Day 2 (09:30–15:00): bronze pour & reveal (hands-on experience), bead‑blast, light finishing, and care tips.
Leave with your finished, bead-blasted bronze (≤10 cm Ø × ≤15 cm).
Optional Add-Ons: Patina service (R1,000 - R3,000) and mounting options will be available for purchase on-site.
